# Contributing

## Contributor Agreement

A pull-request will only be considered for merging into the upstream codebase after you have signed our [contributor agreement](https://github.com/snyk/nodejs-lockfile-parser/main/Contributor-Agreement.md), assigning us the rights to the contributed code and granting you a license to use it in return. If you submit a pull request, you will be prompted to review and sign the agreement with one click (we use [CLA assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/)).

## Commit messages

Commit messages must follow the [Angular-style](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-format) commit format (but excluding the scope).

i.e:

```text
fix: minified scripts being removed

Also includes tests
```

This will allow for the automatic changelog to generate correctly.

### Commit types

Must be one of the following:

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **test**: Adding missing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance

To release a major you need to add `BREAKING CHANGE: ` to the start of the body and the detail of the breaking change.

## Code standards

Ensure that your code adheres to the included `.eslintrc.json` config by running `npm run lint`.

## Sending pull requests

- new command line options are generally discouraged unless there's a _really_ good reason
- add tests for newly added code (and try to mirror directory and file structure if possible)
- spell check
- PRs will not be code reviewed unless all tests are passing

_Important:_ when fixing a bug, please commit a **failing test** first so that Travis CI (or I can) can show the code failing. Once that commit is in place, then commit the bug fix, so that we can test _before_ and _after_.

Remember that you're developing for multiple platforms and versions of node, so if the tests pass on your Mac or Linux or Windows machine, it _may_ not pass elsewhere.
